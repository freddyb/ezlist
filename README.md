# ezlist #
If you have been looking for a mailing list manager, you know the problem:
Either you use extremely overfeatured software like mailman or you end up with a
strange PHP script somebody hacked together. I hope that ezlist will some day be
a real alternative for those who do not have to manage a huge mailing list and
do not require many of the more advanced features of such software. However,
right now ezlist is strictly experimental albeit working. I will write
documentation at a later point...

This script requires Python 3 to work properly.
